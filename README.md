## About LifeBookApp
LifebookApp is a web application that made by me, the main aim of the app is about daily journaling and habit or routines tracker.. actually this project Was made to support my school curicullum that include about self growth, and this app is like one of medium that the student can choose to use as their self growth tracker..

The web application was split up into [FrontEnd](https://github.com/ItsJiran/LifebookApp_FrontEnd) and [BackEnd](https://github.com/ItsJiran/LifebookApp_BackEnd). why i split it up instead of monolithic is because i want to build SinglePage Application so it act like real application, no reloading for switching between pages..

You can see the application in this following video : https://youtu.be/KWsCn52xOEc

**TechStacks** : ReactJs, Laravel, MariaDB, Webpack, Tailwind, EditorJs.. 

**Disclaimer** : I'm sorry if the code where dirty, this is actually my first time building a WebApp especially for a really complex project.
